</span>

This project provides a free [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) based Raspberry Pi image with [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) and [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-config-ui-x) pre-installed.

* Works on all Raspberry Pi models
* Built on Raspbian Lite (no desktop)
* Simple WiFi Setup
* Includes `ffmpeg` pre-compiled with audio support (libfdk-aac)
* Includes a user friendly, easy to use web based GUI to configure Homebridge and monitor your Raspberry Pi
* Visual configuration for over 400 plugins (no manual config.json editing required)

This image also provides a command called `hb-config` which helps you keep Node.js up-to-date, perform maintenance on your Homebridge server, and install additional optional software such as *[Pi Hole](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-raspbian-image/wiki/How-To-Install-Pi-Hole)* and *[deCONZ](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-raspbian-image/wiki/How-To-Install-deCONZ-for-ConBee-or-RaspBee)*.

The Homebridge service is installed using the method described in the official [Raspberry Pi Installation Guide](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Install-Homebridge-on-Raspbian) on the [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) project wiki.

## Download and Flash to SD Card

The *Homebridge Raspberry Pi Image* is completely free (no sign up required).

1. Download and install the latest version of [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).
2. Open the *Raspberry Pi Imager* application.
3. Click **Choose OS**.
4. Scroll down and select the **Other specific purpose OS** category.
5. Select the **Home assistants and home automation** category.
6. Select **Homebridge**, then choose the latest Homebridge image.
7. Click **Choose Storage** and select your SD card.
8. Click **Write**.

*Raspberry Pi Imager* will now download and flash the latest version of the *Homebridge Raspberry Pi Image* to your SD card, this may take several minutes depending on the speed of your internet connection and SD card.

**Advanced users:**

If you wish to use another tool such as [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [`dd`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md) to flash the Homebridge Raspberry Pi Image, you can manually download the image from our releases page:

## First Boot / Network Setup

Now that you have flashed your SD card, you can insert it into your Raspberry Pi.

Before powering on your Raspberry Pi decide if you want to use Ethernet or WiFi to connect to your network.

### Ethernet

**:warning: An Ethernet connection is recommended as this provides the most simple and stable Homebridge setup.**

If you have decided to connect your Raspberry Pi using ethernet, do so before you power on your device for the first time. 

### WiFi Setup

Follow these steps to connect your device to WiFi:

1. Power on your device without an Ethernet cable attached.
2. Wait 1-2 minutes
3. Use your mobile phone to scan for new WiFi networks
4. Connect to the hotspot named **Homebridge WiFi Setup**
5. Wait a few moments until the captive portal opens, this portal will allow you to connect the Raspberry Pi to your local WiFi network.

If you enter your WiFi credentials incorrectly the **Homebridge WiFi Setup** hotspot will reappear allowing you to try again.

## Managing Homebridge

The [Homebridge UI](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-config-ui-x) web interface will allow you to install, remove and update plugins, and modify the Homebridge config.json and manage other aspects of your Homebridge service.

If you're using macOS or a mobile device, you should be able to access the UI via http://homebridge.local.

If you're using Windows, or `http://homebridge.local` does not work for you, you will need to find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi another way:

1. Login to your router and find the "connected devices" or "dhcp clients" page to find the IP address that was assigned to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Use an iPhone to access `http://homebridge.local`, once you login using the default username and password (admin/admin) you can find the IP address under System Information.
3. Download the [Fing](https://www.fing.com/) app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fing-network-scanner/id430921107?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing&hl=en_GB) to scan your network to find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.
4. As a last resort, if you plug a monitor into your Raspberry Pi, the IP address will be displayed on the attached screen once it has finished booting.

Once you've found your IP address, login to the web interface by going to `http://<ip address of your server>`.
