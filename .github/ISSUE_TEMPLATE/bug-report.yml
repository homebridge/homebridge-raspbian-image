        Before we start, be sure you are aware of the following points:
        
        * If your issue is specific to a certain plugin, create the issue on that plugin's GitHub project page instead.
        * Avoid duplicating any existing issues which already track or resolve your problem, search the existing issues first.
        * Aim to find a descriptive and precise title for your bug report.
